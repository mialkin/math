## SymPy

[↑ SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) is a Python library for symbolic mathematics.

It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python.
